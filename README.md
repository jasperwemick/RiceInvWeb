# Rice Invitational Webpage

The Rice Invitational is a tournament I made for my friends and I where everyone is competing in a multitude of games to determine which of us is the GREATEST GAMER

I made this webpage as an educational experience for myself and for my friends and I to use as a tool for data records and scheduling

Thanks for visiting - Jasper
